- Hi, Iâ€™m Bryce Dyck, a current BCS computer science student at UBC. I am particularly interested in the sports industry, game development, graphics, and computer vision. However, I am new to the industry I am open to any and all learning experiences.
- I am a former Research Tech II in the Tyson Lab at UBCO, where I worked on developing novel models of extinction in discrete time systems, primarily utilizing MATLAB
- On a more personal level, I am obsessed with the outdoors, and love skiing, backpacking, biking, playing soccer and anything else that gets me outside
- If you're looking to collaborate, or are interested in my former research, please reach out via email at bryce.f.dyck@gmail.com ðŸ“«
