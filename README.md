- 👋 Hi, I’m Bryce Dyck, a current research assistant working on models of extinction at UBCO
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematical modelling of extinction events, particularly as they relate to climate change and human actions, but I also am learning software development on my own.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development, as well as C# for game development in Unity. Outside of software development I am learning about bifurcations of difference equations, and how they relate to extinctions in predator prey models. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything game dev related, as well as anything involving biomathematics
- 📫 How to reach me: bryce.dyck@alumni.ubc.ca
